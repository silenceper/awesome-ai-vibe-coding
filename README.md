> **"Programming is no longer about writing syntax; it's about holding the vision and letting the AI handle the friction."** 
> —— *The Vibe Coding Manifesto* 🌊

**Vibe-coding** is a revolutionary development paradigm. It emphasizes "creative expression" over "syntax implementation." Through powerful AI agents and intuitive tech stacks, developers can maintain an ultimate "flow state," building products through conversation like a conductor orchestrating a symphony.
